# Prepare Your Environment Guide:

If you already have NodeJS environment, you can skip the Prepare your environment Guide,
however if it´s the first time that you configure a NodeJS development environment make sure to follow the instructions bellow:

# Installation Guide for MacOS:

#### Step 1: Download and Install NodeJS on the stable version: - [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

#### Step 2: To avoid issues with zsh, install HomeBrew: -[HomeBrew Installation Guide](http://docs.brew.sh/Installation)

#### Step 3: Install JAVA JDK: -[Open JDK](https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/downloads/)

#### Step 4: Setup Enviroment Variables:

### NOTE:

On MacOS 10.15 Catalina or later, the default Terminal shell switch from bash(Bourne-again shell) to zsh( Z shell).

> For bash, the environment variables are setup at ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc .
>
> For zsh, the environment variables are setup at ~/.zshenv or ~/.zshrc .
>
> Run `$SHELL` command line to check enviroment variable to determine the current shell is in use.

In older MacOS version you can find more details here: [guide](https://mkyong.com/java/how-to-set-java-home-environment-variable-on-mac-os-x)

##### Step 4.1: Open the environment configuration file:

```sh
nano ~/.zshenv
```

or

```sh
nano ~/.zshrc
```

##### Step 4.2: Edit the file adding the following information:

`export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)`

##### Step 4.3: Check the changes

```sh
echo $JAVA_HOME
```

#### Step 5: Start the Testware Project

##### For a New Project: Step 5.1: Install WebdriverIO

```sh
npm init wdio@latest .
```

If you intend to start a new project using WebdriverIO with the same configuration used in this project, make sure to answer the WDIO Configuration Wizard with the following information:

##### For a Existent Project: Step 5.1: Clone the project

    ```sh
    git clone YOUR_PROJECT_GIT
    ```

##### Step 5.2: Install the dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

#### Step 6: Install and Step Appim Inspector: -[Appium Inspector](https://github.com/appium/appium-inspector)

#### Step 7: Testing the .apk or .app

- Download the test version of the .apk(Android) or .app(iOS)
- Move the system under test to the appropriate folder Android(./application/android) or iOS(./application/ios)

#### Step 8: Executing the Test Cases

#### Execution Guide

## To push a result to Test Rail you should add a Tag with the Test Case ID, like the following example:

    Feature: Login on the Application

    @C123456 @ios @android
    Scenario: As a user, I want to login
         Given ...

#### To run a test with a special tag:

##### android:

```bash
PLATFORM=android npm run test_android "@tag"
```

##### iOS:

```bash
PLATFORM=ios npm run test_ios "@tag"
```
